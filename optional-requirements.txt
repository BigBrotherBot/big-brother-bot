# Python modules needed for optional B3 features
# If you want to install them with pip on Windows then you will need Microsofts Visual C++ Compiler for Python2.7

# You can also use pre-compiled versions for windows.
# A pre-compiled Windows version of psycopg2 v2.6 can be found here http://www.stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/
# A pre-compiled version of pycrypto that is needed for paramiko can be found here http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto
# That should be enough for you to install paramiko with pip, but if not a pre-compiled version of paramiko can be found here
