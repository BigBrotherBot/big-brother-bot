[configmanager]
# Configmanager setting enables you to load different server config files from 'configmanager' folder
# based on gametypes/maps. (Ported from xlr8or's config manager plugin for cod series)
#
# It will first look if a b3_<gametype>_<mapname>.cfg exists (example: b3_teamdeathmatch0_mp001.cfg)
# and execute it. If it doesn't exist, it checks for b3_<gametype>.cfg (example: b3_rushlarge0.cfg).
#
# If none of them exist, it will look for b3_main.cfg. This file makes it possible to reset certain
# vars, so always create a b3_main.cfg if you want to enable and use this feature.
#
# Options:
# on  : enable configmanager
# off : disable configmanager
status: on
