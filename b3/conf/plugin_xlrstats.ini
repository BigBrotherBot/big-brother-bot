# *** assist bonus settings ***
# Call of Duty passes damage amount info to the logs. Therefore we can award assists based on damage.
# So in the CoD series we award an assist if the amount of damage is 50 points or more and they must occur
# within 10 seconds before the victim dies. In other games we shorten the timespan because we don't have
# the amount of damage available, we have to award all assists, even the very tiny ones. The shorter time
# compensates for that.
#
# damage_assist_release: timespan the assist must have taken place before the victim dies ( Call of Duty )
# damage_assist_release: 10
#
# assist_timespan: timespan the assist must have taken place before the victim dies ( Other than Call of Duty )
# assist_timespan: 2
