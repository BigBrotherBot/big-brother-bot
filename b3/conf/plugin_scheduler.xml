    This config file is where you can schedule tasks you want B3 to execute.

  Scheduling
  ==========

    Tasks can be one of : daily, hourly, restart, cron

    Daily tasks will be executed every day. Optionally you can specify at 
    which hour and minutes of each day it will be executed.

    Hourly tasks will be executed every hours. Optionally you can specify at 
    which minutes of each hour it will be executed.

    Restart tasks will be executed when B3 starts or restarts. Optionally you
    can specify a delay before the task is executed.

    Cron tasks are the most powerful way to schedule tasks execution. It schedule
    tasks as complicated as : every 7, 14 and 20 minute of each even hours on 
    mondays and thursdays from the 1st to 15th of each month.
    For more information on the Cron scheduling syntax, please refer to the crontab
    manuals you can find on the Internet : http://www.google.com/search?q=man+crontab+5

  Commands
  ========

    Each task is composed of at least one command of type :
       rcon, frostbite, enable_plugin, disable_plugin

    rcon and frostbite commands are commands you want B3 to send to your game
    server. rcon commands are for games accepting classic rcon commands while
    frostibe commands are for games based on the Frostibe game engine.

    Let say you want to execute "yourCommand arg1 arg2"

        If your game is based on Quake3 :
            <rcon>yourCommand arg1 arg2</rcon>

        If your game is based on Frostbite (BFBC2, MoH, etc) :
            <frostbite command="yourCommand">
                <arg>argument 1</arg>
                <arg>argument 2</arg>
            </frostbite>

    Example :

        If you want to run the punkbuster command 'pb_sv_update' every night at 3:30 am

        for Quake3 like games :
            <daily name="myDailyPBupdate" hour="3" minutes="30">
                <rcon>pb_sv_update</rcon>
            </daily>

        for Frostbite like games :
            <daily name="myDailyPBupdate" hour="3" minutes="30">
                <frostbite command="punkBuster.pb_sv_command">
                    <arg>pb_sv_update</arg>
                </frostbite>
            </daily>

    enable_plugin and disable_plugin are commands that make B3 enable or disable
    any plugin. Let say you want to enable the tk plugin only at night when no
    admin is online, use the following tasks :
       <daily name="turn OFF tk in the morning" hour="9">
        <disable_plugin plugin="tk" />
     </daily>
       <daily name="turn ON tk at night" hour="22">
        <enable_plugin plugin="tk" />
     </daily>

    -->

    <daily name="daily1">
        <rcon>bigtext "It's midnight, go to bed kids"</rcon>
        <rcon>bigtext "seriously"</rcon>
    </daily>

    <daily name="daily1" hour="2" minutes="41">
        <rcon>bigtext "hi from daily2"</rcon>
    </daily>


    <hourly name="hourly1">
        <rcon>bigtext "hi from hourly1"</rcon>
    </hourly>

    <hourly name="hourly2" minutes="43">
        <rcon>bigtext "hi from hourly2"</rcon>
    </hourly>


    <cron name="every3m" minutes="*/3" >
        <rcon>say "^7every3m"</rcon>
    </cron>

    <cron name="every4h5m" minutes="5" hour="*/4" >
        <rcon>say "^7every4h5m"</rcon>
    </cron>

    <cron name="every2day13h45m" minutes="45" hour="13" day="*/2" >
        <rcon>say "^7every2day13h45m"</rcon>
    </cron>  

    <cron name="newYear" minutes="0" hour="0" day="1" month="1">
        <rcon>bigtext "Happy new year !"</rcon>
    </cron>  

    <cron name="everyMondayMorningAt7am" minutes="0" hour="7" dow="1">
        <rcon>bigtext "mondays, pfff...."</rcon>
    </cron>
