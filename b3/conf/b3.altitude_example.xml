<!-- 
 If you want to generate a new config file and make sure the format is 
 correct, you can invoke the setup procedure with the 
 command : b3_run -s b3.xml

 This is B3 main config file (the one you specify when you run B3 with the 
 command : b3_run -c b3.xml) 

 For any change made in this config file, you have to restart the bot.
 Whenever you can specify a file/directory path, the following shortcuts
 can be used :
  @b3 : the folder where B3 code is installed in
  @conf : the folder containing this config file

		<!-- Define here the plugins you want to load.
            
            Plugin order is important. Plugins that add new in-game commands all
			depend on the admin plugin. Make sure to have the admin plugin before
			them. 
            
            You can load a plugin but having it diabled by default. This
            allows to later enabled it ingame with the !enable command. To do so use
            the following syntax :
                <plugin name="adv" config="@conf/plugin_adv.xml" disabled="yes"/>
            
            You can override the plugin path (official plugins and extplugins folders) 
            by specifying the exact location of the plugin file with the 'path' attribute : 
                <plugin name="adv" config="@conf/plugin_adv.xml" path="c:/somewhere/else/"/>
            
            -->
		<plugin name="admin" config="@conf/plugin_admin.ini" />
		<!--
        <plugin name="censor" config="@conf/plugin_censor.xml" />
		<plugin name="spamcontrol" config="@conf/plugin_spamcontrol.xml" />
        <plugin name="admin" config="@conf/plugin_admin.ini" />
		<plugin name="tk" config="@conf/plugin_tk.xml" />
		<plugin name="stats" config="@conf/plugin_stats.xml" />
		<plugin name="pingwatch" config="@conf/plugin_pingwatch.xml" />
		<plugin name="adv" config="@conf/plugin_adv.xml" />

		<plugin name="welcome" config="@conf/plugin_welcome.xml" />

		<!-- The next plugins are external, 3rd party plugins and should reside in the external_dir. Example: -->
		<!-- plugin config="@b3/extplugins/conf/newplugin.xml" name="newplugin" -->

		<!-- You can add new/custom plugins to this list using the same form as above. -->
		
		<!--
			This is a non-standard plugin, and quite resource heavy. Please take
			a look in the B3 forums (look for XLR Extensions) for more
			information before enabling this. Extra database tables are
			necessary.
