18/09/2014 - 1.2   - Fenix - added command !cmdgrant: allow the execution of a command to a specific client

20/12/2014 - 1.3   - Fenix - fixed invalid placeholder in mysql related SQL statements
                           - use client auth event instead of client connect: in client connect, client.id is not set
                             and so we can't load command grants from the storage
24/12/2014 - 1.3.1 - Fenix - use only EVT_CLIENT_AUTH: this event is fired in all the parser and behaves exactly in
                             the same way no matter the game we are running
31/12/2014 - 1.3.2 - Fenix - moved hardcoded SQL code for creating tables in B3 sql scripts
