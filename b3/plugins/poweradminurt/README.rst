  Adding *'lock'* will lock the player where it is forced to.

  Using *'all free'* wil release all locks.

  **Usage examples**

  Moving Bill to the red team :
    - `!force bill red`

  *all* allow all weapons

  *none* will only allow the knife

  *reset* will put back the settings as they were before B3 started

  Use *+* before a weapon group to allow it

  Use *-* before a weapon group to disallow it

  If you want to disable only one weapon/item instead of weapon group, have a look at the plugins weaponcontrolurt  and weaponcontrolurt42. They allow to disallow smoke grenades while allowing HE for instance, or can disallow the kelvar vest.


!pagear (!gear) <all/none/reset/[+-]weapon/item/group> *for UrT 4.2*
  set allowed/disallowed weapons or items

  *all* allow all weapons

  *none* will only allow the knife

  *reset* will put back the settings as they were before B3 started

  Use *+* before a weapon/item to allow it

  Use *-* before a weapon/item to disallow it

  Accepted *weapon* and *item* names are what you would expect. I.E. *spas* for the SPAS, *de* for Desert Eagle .50, etc.

  Accepted *group* names are stricly one of:

  - *all_nades*: for all HE and Smoke grenades
  - *all_snipers*: for SR8 and PSG1
  - *all_pistols*: for Beretta 92FS, .50 Desert Eagle, Glock and Colt1911
  - *all_auto*: for MPK5, LR300ML, Colt M4, MAC11, UMP45, G36, AK.103 and Negev LMG

  For instance, you can make your server a SR8 only with the following command::

    !gear none +sr8

  If you want to only allow any sniper rifles::

    !gear none +all_snipers

  or maybe you just want to forbid smoke grenades::

Other features
--------------

Autobalancer
~~~~~~~~~~~~

When active the autobalancer makes sure the teams will always be balanced. When a player joins a team that is already
outnumbering the other team B3 will immediately correct the player to the right team. The balancer also checks on
(configurable) intervals if balancing is needed. In that case it will balance the player with the least teamtime, so
the player that joined the team last will be force to the other team.


Namechecker
~~~~~~~~~~~

When active it checks for unwanted playernames. This is a simple function and warns players using duplicate names, the
name 'all' or 'New UrT Player' depending on the config. Three warnings without a responding rename action will result
in a kick.


Vote Delayer
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can disable voting during the first minutes of a round. Set the number of minutes in the config and voting will be
disabled for that amount of time.


Spec Checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Controls how long a player may stay in spec before being warned. All parameters are configurable.

**Important!**

In order to make Spec checker work it is crucial you edit *b3/conf/plugin_admin.xml*

Open the file with your favorite text editor and look for the next line:
  `<set name="spectator">5m, ^7spectator too long on full server</set>`
Change it to:
  `<set name="spectator">1h, ^7spectator too long on full server</set>`


Bot Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

This will crash your server. I've put it in here as a challenge for you programmers out there to fix us a stable version.


Headshot counter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Broadcasts headshots made by players.


RotationManager
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Switches between different mapcycles, based on the playercount.
