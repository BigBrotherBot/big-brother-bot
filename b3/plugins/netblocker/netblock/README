== What it is:

netblock.py implements sets of IP address ranges, supporting various
notation including CIDR. It does not require contiguous IP address
ranges.

ranges.py implements (integer) ranges, hopefully efficiently. It is used
by netblock.py.

nbcalc.py is a netblock calculator. See the comments at its start for
usage information, for now.

=== Bugs:

- nbcalc.py needs a manpage

=== Copyright:

GPL v3 for now.
