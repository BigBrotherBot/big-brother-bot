The Welcome plugin
==================

The welcome plugin will welcome players that join the game server.

You can define different messages that will be sent privately to players depending on if it is the first time
the player joins the server of if he is a registered player.

Also you can define announcement messages that are broadcasted to all players when a player joins for the first time
or if he is a registered player.

Finally you can allow players to define their own custom announcement message that will be displayed to all on joining
the server. This custom greeting is to be set with the :command:`!greeting` command.

.. note::
  The plugin won't welcome anyone in the 5 first minutes after B3 started.
