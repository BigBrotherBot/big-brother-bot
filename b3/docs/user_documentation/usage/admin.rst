The Admin plugin
================

The admin plugin is at the heart of BigBrotherBot. It brings to B3 the user groups and in-game commands.

It allows the gameserver owner to define his staff by assigning trusted players to the different administration groups.
Depending on their group membership, players will be given access to administrating commands which allow them to:

- display the server rules
- warn a user
- kick
- ban
- change map
- change the gamemode
- etc

.. _groups:

Groups and levels
-----------------

B3's permissions are based on groups and levels. Players are assigned to groups and each group has a level. Commands can
be run by users that have the minimum level needed to use the command.

B3 has 8 user groups, each serving a different purpose. Several commands are available to assign players to group :

- `register`_
- `makereg`_
- `unreg`_
- `putgroup`_
- `ungroup`_

guest / level 0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a default group for any player joining your gameserver who is not member of any other group.

user / level 1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Players of group *Users* are self appointed regulars. New players can use the :command:`!register` command to gain user
status.
User's have only a few commands but gain extra privileges that would be ignored for the one-time visit players.

reg / level 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Regulars* are not admins or moderators, but your loyal server population. You would only give
regular status to members of your community who follow the rules and play on your server often. *Regulars* not only get
a status symbol, but access to a few more commands than the average user. By default, only *Senior Admins* and up can
appoint regulars with the :command:`!makereg` command.

mod / level 20
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Moderators* group is meant for regular players who earned the trust of the gameserver admins. They know and agree
with the gameserver rules and are given a few commands to help the admin staff educate other players in regards with the
gameserver rules. They are the first step to becoming an admin, an admin training ground if you will. They can only
:command:`!warn` users or remind them of the rules. They can notify higher level admins when harsher punishment is
needed.

admin / level 40
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Admins* are the first level of administrators. Their harshest punishment is a :command:`!kick`, yet they are probably
the most numerous of the admins.

fulladmin / level 60
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Full Admins* have less authority than *Senior Admins* but still have access to harsher punishment commands such as
:command:`!ban`.

senioradmin / level 80
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Senior Admins* are usually the highest admins that play and admin on the server often. They have access to most
commands except for the commands used in server/bot setup. Choose your *Senior Admins* wisely for they have the full
regiment of commands to enforce your server policy.

superadmin / level 100
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *Super Admin* is the highest level of authority. A *Super Admin* has access to all commands and is generally only
assigned to the server operators.
