  The next settings enable the plugin to retrieve certain config settings from your webfront install
  This will make topstats return the same results as the webfront.
  You'll need at least webfront version 2.2 for this to work.
  The webfronturl should point to your xlrstats website, ie: http://www.yoursite.com/xlrstats
  The servernumber is the confignumber of the webfront install when you're using multiple servers and one xlrstats install

<!-- *** assist bonus settings ***
	Call of Duty passes damage amount info to the logs. Therefore we can award assists based on damage.
	So in the CoD series we award an assist if the amount of damage is 50 points or more and they must occur
	within 10 seconds before the victim dies. In other games we shorten the timespan because we don't have
	the amount of damage available, we have to award all assists, even the very tiny ones. The shorter time
	compensates for that.
