Module description
==================

This module contains unittests on features that are common to both the iourt41 and iourt42 versions of the plugin
under test.

Typical test module will define a mixin with the actual tests and later define two classes using that mixin, one
inheriting from test.iourt41.Iourt41TestCase and the other one from test.iourt42.Iourt42TestCase.


Example
-------

class mixin_foo(object):
    def setUp(self):
        super(mixin_cmd_nuke, self).setUp()

    def test_foo():
        self.assertEqual('foo', 'foo')


class Test_41(mixin_foo, Iourt41TestCase):
    """
    call the mixin tests using the Iourt41TestCase parent class
    """

class Test_42(mixin_foo, Iourt42TestCase):
    """
    call the mixin tests using the Iourt42TestCase parent class
    """
