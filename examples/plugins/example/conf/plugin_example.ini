[settings]
# This setting value controls where messages coming from this plugin will be printed.
# It is a boolean value, so accepted tokens are: True, yes, on, 1 and False, no, off, 00.
use_saybig: yes
# This setting value controls the scheduled execution. In our example plugin we set up a schedule execution
# of a function which gives an extra cookie to all the connected players. The default is 60 (which means 60 seconds),
# so every minute, all the players will receive an extra cookie.
refill_interval = 60

[command]
# This command can be executed using !hello and !hi (the dash between the 2 tokens split
# the command name and the command alias) by everyone (since guest is specified as minimum
# required level to be able to execute this command).
hello-hi: guest
# This command can be executed using !cookie (no command alias is provided here) by
# moderators (and higher level clients). If you want to make restrictions on the maximum level too,
# you can space the command level with a dash, i.e: cookie: mod-fulladmin (senioradmin and superadmin levels
# won't be able to execute the command).
cookie: mod

[messages]
# NOTE: not all the in-game messages needs (or specify) a message pattern: messages can
# be hardcoded into the plugin python implementation (this plugin hardcode some of them)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# This message pattern will be used in the !hello command.
# Available tokens $client and $target will be replaced with respectively the client name (the client who
# issued the command) and the target name (specified in the command parameter). See the command implementation
# for more information.
hello_message: $client says hello to $target
# This message pattern will be used in the !cookie command.
# Available tokens $client, $num and $target will be replaced with respectively the client name (the client who
# issued the command), the amount of cookies and the target name (specified in the command parameter). See the
# command implementation for more information.
cookie_message: $client gives $num cookies to $target
