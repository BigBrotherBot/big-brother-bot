- In plugin config files, you can use group keywords (user, reg, mod, admin, fulladmin, senioradmin, superadmin) instead of group levels when defining commands' required level

- Many minor bugfixes and improvements to B3 core and native plugins

# New games supported:

Urban Terror 4.2
 - UrT 4.2 has now its own B3 parser : iourt42
 - New penalty available : kill. You can use it in the censor plugin configuration for instance.
 - The Spamcontrol plugin reacts to radio message spamming
 - Fires game specific events for plugins : EVT_CLIENT_RADIO, EVT_CLIENT_CALLVOTE, EVT_CLIENT_VOTE, EVT_GAME_FLAG_HOTPOTATO for other plugins to act on.
 - There are new settings in the b3.xml config file to let you choose if you want to ban using the Frozen Sand auth system (with the rcon 'auth-ban' command). Have a look at the b3.iourt42.tpl template config file

CoD8 / 4D1
 - B3 now supports CoD8 from 4D1. See http://forum.bigbrotherbot.net/call-of-duty-8-%28modern-warfare-3%29/

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive
 - beta support for CS:GO (B3 parser code: csgo, requires SourceMod on the game server, and '-condebug' parameter on the game server command line)

ArmA II
 - ArmA II and DayZ are now supported. Use the B3 parser 'arma2' for both of them.

Ravaged
 - Ravaged by 2Dawn is now supported.

# Upgrading note:

* Now B3 ensures group levels do exists when used in plugin config files. The plugin_admin.xml config files was using bad group level prior to B3 1.9.
  Make sure to correct them by comparing your own plugin_admin.xml with the new one.
* SpamControl plugin : The config file plugin_spamcontrol.xml has a new section regarding the !spamins command. Make sure to update your config file.
* FTP : if your b3.xml is set up to read your game server log file over ftp, then you may have to adjust the game_log value if you see that it isn't working good anymore. The correct url to
  set for game_log is the url that works in your Internet Browser.
