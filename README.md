Big Brother Bot (B3) is a complete and total server administration package for online games. It is the prefered ingame
RCON Tool currently available. B3 is designed primarily to keep your server free from the derelicts of online gaming,
but offers more, much more. With the stock configuration files, B3 will keep your server free from offensive language,
and team killers alike. A completely automated and customizable warning system will warn the offending players that this
type of behavior is not allowed on your server, and ultimately kick, and or ban them for a predetermined time limit.

### For developers

B3 is an extremely extensible software. Support for new online games can be added quite easily by creating new parsers
(if the game server meets the necessary requirements), and B3 functionalities can be enhanced by means of plugins. You 
can browse B3 code reference [here](http://doc.bigbrotherbot.net/): it will give you a general idea on the structure of B3 
core and B3 plugins. You can also find some plugins and parsers examples in the _example_ directory. If you need some 
help in developing your plugins or creating new parsers you can make use of our  [forums](http://forum.bigbrotherbot.net)
